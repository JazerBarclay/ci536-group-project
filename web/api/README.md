## API Structure

## How to install
To setup this api server on your local machine or on a live server, follow the appropriate section below.

### Local testing
This is a simple web server built using Express

To run in devmode, run the following command in the console:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will run the application in development mode where any save will trigger the server to recompile the code locally saving you time.

### Server deployment
To deploy on the server, use this command instead:

```bash
npm run start
```

This will compile and run a single instance of the express server.
